  # Write two recursive functions: one that finds the biggest element of a list
  # and another that finds the smallest. You should use them like this:
  # MyList.max([4, 2, 16, 9, 10])
  # # => 16
  # MyList.min([4, 2, 16, 9, 10])
  # # => 2

  # In the section Transforming Lists, on page 62, we traveled to a fantasy
  # world and enchanted some items. Create a new module called GeneralStore
  # where you can create a function that filters based on whether the products
  # are magical. You can use the same test data from EnchanterShop :
  #
  # GeneralStore.filter_items(GeneralStore.test_data, magic: true)
  # # => [%{title: "Healing Potion", price: 60, magic: true},
  # # %{title: "Dragon's Spear", price: 100, magic: true}]
  # GeneralStore.filter_items(GeneralStore.test_data, magic: false)
  # # => [%{title: "Longsword", price: 50, magic: false},
  # # %{title: "Rope", price: 10, magic: false}]

  # We’ve created a function that sorts the items of a list in ascending order.
  # Now create a Sort.descending/1 function that sorts the elements in descending
  # order.

  # We’ve written a lot of recursive functions, but not all of them are tail
  # recursive. Write the tail-recursive versions of Sum.up_to/1 and Math.sum/1 .
  # Extra challenge: write the tail-recursive version of Sort.merge/2 .

  # In the section Adding Boundaries, on page 75, we added a depth restriction
  # to limit how many directories deep our module should dive. Now create
  # a BreadthNavigator module that has a breadth constraint; it will be the
  # maximum number of sibling directories it can navigate.
